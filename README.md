## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
	Two conclusions that can be drawn from the graph below are:
	1. All outcomes seem to follow the same trends based on month of the year
	2. Summer (May-July) appears to be the best time to launch a theater project, and winter (Nov-Jan) seems to be the worst time to launch a theater project.

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
	At the lower funding goal ranges, a large percentage of projects are succesful. As you begin moving into mid-range funding goals, rates of project success and failure both begin to approach ~50%, indicating that at this funding range there's about a 50% chance of success or failure. As you begin approaching the higher end funding ranges the data becomes more unpredictable, and rates of success and failure fluctuate quite a bit between high-end ranges. This might be due to lower n values (fewer projects) in the high-end ranges, which could skew the results.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
