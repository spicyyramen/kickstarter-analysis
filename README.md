# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
To analyze Kickstarter data and uncover trends.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise determine whether her funding goal is reasonable and when she should launch her play project using the data from other Kickstarter projects as our reference data.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

### Theater Outcomes Vs Launch Date
**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
	Two conclusions that can be drawn from the graph below are:
	1. All outcomes seem to follow the same trends based on month of the year
	2. Summer (May-July) appears to be the best time to launch a theater project, and winter (Nov-Jan) seems to be the worst time to launch a theater project.

### Outcomes vs Goals
**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
	At the lower funding goal ranges, a large percentage of projects are succesful. As you begin moving into mid-range funding goals, rates of project success and failure both begin to approach ~50%, indicating that at this funding range there's about a 50% chance of success or failure. As you begin approaching the higher end funding ranges the data becomes more unpredictable, and rates of success and failure fluctuate quite a bit between high-end ranges. This might be due to lower n values (fewer projects) in the high-end ranges, which could skew the results. This indicates that lower funding goals often result in successful campaigns, mid-level funding goals result in successful campaigns approximately 50% of the time, and the success of high funding goal projects is inconsistent and unpredictable.

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**
One limitation of this dataset is we do not know some of the other factors that contributed to whether a campaign met its funding goals or not. For instance, we do not know how different types of advertising may have helped some campaigns reach their goals more effectively than others. 

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
